##Prime Factors

A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.

Note that 1 is not a prime number.

##Example

What are the prime factors of 60?

Our first divisor is 2. 2 goes into 60, leaving 30.
2 goes into 30, leaving 15.
2 doesn't go cleanly into 15. So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.
3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.
3 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 4.
4 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 5.
5 does go cleanly into 5.
We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.
Our successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.

You can check this yourself:

2 * 2 * 3 * 5
= 4 * 15
= 60
Success!x

###Notes

Prior understanding of python classes, returning, and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make it.

Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
